        <h2>EIF Assignment</h2>
        <p>Brainstorm:
            In the future I want to have a good group of friends and a job I enjoy. I want to have a good relationship with my family and be close to them. I want to have a family and get a nice house with a big backyard. I want to have one or two dogs. I want to do something in cybersecurity or programming as that is my dream job. There are a lot of different opportunities in cybersecurity and programming but the ones I'm striving for are Software developer, Pentester, Game developer and Ethical hacker. To do some of the jobs I want to do it would help if I got a computer science degree. The basic degree has a guaranteed entry ATAR of 80 and the advanced course is 95. If i can i want to do the advanced course but it is going to be much harder and i will need to put more effort in. At home I try to practise with online resources and use online tools to up my skills and be more prepared when going into a career or university course. I also am learning to program games on unity on the side when I have got free time.

        <p><b>70 YEAR OLD SPEECH</b>
           <p>Ladies and gentlemen, family, and friends, welcome! Today, we gather to celebrate a remarkable milestone in the life of an extraordinary individual, my husband, father, and friend, Nate. As we mark his 70th birthday, I am honored to stand here and reflect on the incredible journey that has brought him to this moment.

            From a young age, Nate demonstrated a keen mind and a passion for learning. His academic achievements were always impressive, but it was his curiosity and dedication that truly set him apart. Graduating high school with an impressive 96 ATAR, he set the bar high for himself, and he never looked back.
            
            As he pursued his Bachelor's degree in Computer Science, Nate discovered his true calling in the field of cybersecurity. His natural aptitude for problem-solving and analytical thinking made him a standout in his field, and he quickly established himself as a rising star in the industry. His dedication to protecting our nation's digital infrastructure has been unwavering, and his work as a cybersecurity expert for the government has been instrumental in safeguarding our country's most sensitive information.</p>
            <p><b>FEEDBACK</b></p>
            <p>I got this feedback from Henry Green and I asked what he thought about my website. "The idea of creating your own website was a great idea however I believe that the idea of a 70th speech isnt great for this format, as, you could have done a website blog about you instead."
            </p>
            <p><b>Career</b></p>
            <p>This website is a example of what my career will look like in the future. I am growing my skills everyday and am working on my cybersecurity, game development, website creation and coding skills everyday. I enjoy doing things like this and creating this website was heaps of fun.</p>
